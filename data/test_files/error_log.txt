Error Log: File Reading Operation
=====================================

Timestamp: 2025-06-17
Operation: Attempted to read file 'data/test_files/nonexistent.txt'
Error Encountered: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

How I Would Handle This Error:
----------------------------

1. **Graceful Error Detection**: The read_file function properly caught the error and returned a clear, structured error message instead of causing a system crash.

2. **Informative Error Reporting**: The error included:
   - The specific operation that failed (file reading)
   - The complete file path that was attempted
   - The system error code and description (Errno 2)

3. **Programmatic Response**: In a real application, I would:
   - Log this error for debugging purposes
   - Check if the file should exist and if not, create it with default values
   - Provide user feedback about the missing file
   - Offer alternatives or suggestions to resolve the issue

4. **Recovery Strategies**:
   - Verify file path correctness
   - Check directory structure
   - Search for similar files with different names
   - Create missing files if appropriate
   - Use default fallback values

This demonstrates robust error handling prevents application crashes and provides clear guidance for resolution.
