# Testing the Validation Error Fix

## Overview

This document provides instructions for testing the fix to validation error tracking in the OpenRouter Provider Validator.

## Background

We discovered that validation errors were not being properly tracked because they were appearing in message parts with `part_kind: "retry-prompt"` rather than as `ToolReturnPart` instances, which is what our code was looking for.

## Test Procedure

1. Run a test with Google Gemini, which frequently produces validation errors:

   ```bash
   python3 agent.py --model google/gemini-2.5-flash --provider google-vertex --prompt file_operations_sequence
   ```

2. Check the console output for messages like:
   ```
   [WARNING] Step 1 had X validation errors
   [INFO] Detected validation error in tool: read_file
   ```

3. Examine the JSON result file in `results/google_gemini-2.5-flash/file_operations_sequence/google-vertex/XXXXXXXX_XXXXXX.json`:
   - Verify `validation_errors` is a non-empty array
   - Check that `validation_error_count` is greater than 0
   - Confirm that `perfect_success` is `false` if validation errors were detected 

4. Run a batch of tests with the test runner to verify reporting:

   ```bash
   python3 test_runner.py --models google/gemini-2.5-flash --prompts file_operations_sequence
   ```

5. Check the generated summary report to verify validation errors are properly aggregated and categorized.

## Expected Results

### Console Output

You should see validation errors being logged to the console during test execution:

```
[INFO] Running step 1/5
[WARNING] Step 1 had 1 validation errors
[INFO] Detected validation error in tool: read_file
```

### Result JSON

The JSON file should contain validation error details:

```json
{
  ...
  "validation_errors": [
    {
      "message": "Error executing tool read_file: 1 validation error for read_fileArguments\nrequest\n  Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of PathRequest [type=model_type, input_value='data/test_files/sample1.txt', input_type=str]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/model_type",
      "tool": "read_file",
      "timestamp": "2025-08-01T12:34:56.789012"
    }
  ],
  "validation_error_count": 1,
  "perfect_success": false,
  ...
}
```

### Summary Report

The summary report should include a section for validation errors:

```markdown
### Validation Error Details

| Error Type | Count | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| model_type_error | 3 | Incorrect model type or format (expected a dict, received a string) |
```

## Troubleshooting

If validation errors still aren't being detected:

1. Check the messages array in the result JSON to confirm validation errors are present
2. Verify that the error patterns in `agent.py` match the actual error messages
3. Enable debug logging to track the validation error detection process in more detail
